# Ender 3 PRO based CNC (Soon TM test building starting late May early June, CAD release shortly after) 

Check out the ["Build guide"](https://github.com/Futtawuh/EnderCNCs/blob/main/Ender3CNC/Manual.md) (not finished) 

- Reusing as much as possible from the Ender 3 PRO down to the screws.
- Cheaper BOM than the original EnderCNC. BOM is mostly just some screws, 2x linear rails for Z and m3/m5 tnuts.
- Easy to scale up or down to any size if not using Ender 3 Pro frame. 

### reusing:
* Frame
* steppers
* wires (might need to extend some)
* leadscrew
* leadscrew nut
* coupler
* mcu
* psu
* most of the nuts and bolts
* vwheels
* alu spacers
* screen if you want
