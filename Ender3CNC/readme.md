## Fully built!
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6816d12f-9653-461b-ad77-0ac71268e209

Print settings I used: PLA+, 5 wall, 5 top, 5 bottom, 40% gyroid.

## My setup:

Im just running the original MCU with Klipper for the control and Fusion360 for CAM (free version) with a klipperized post processor. So far nonreal issues. You might want to swap to a board with TMC control (skr pico/micro4) if you realy want to push it.  Im using an old laptop with Ubuntu with klipper on as a substitute for a Raspberry pi. 

You can ofcourse go the GRBL route if you want. I just wanted to use klipper since people coming from 3D printers are somewhat familiar with that.

 

## Check out the ["Build guide"](https://github.com/Futtawuh/EnderCNCs/blob/main/Ender3CNC/Manual.md) (not finished) 

- Reusing as much as possible from the Ender 3 PRO down to the screws.
- Cheaper BOM than the original EnderCNC. BOM is mostly just some screws, 2x linear rails for Z and m3/m5 tnuts.
- Easy to scale up or down to any size if not using Ender 3 Pro frame. 

### reusing:
* Frame
* steppers
* wires (might need to extend some)
* leadscrew
* leadscrew nut
* coupler
* mcu
* psu
* most of the nuts and bolts
* vwheels
* alu spacers
* screen if you want
