# 04.06.2025

### Ender3pro-CNC CAD uploaded!
- Fully built by me and a "beta" tester. Everything should fit nicely and easy enough to assemble!
- Build guide still not 100% finished, but it should give most pointers that you need
- Build guide and CAD is found ["HERE!"](https://github.com/Futtawuh/EnderCNCs/tree/main/Ender3CNC)
- If you need .step contact me on Discord: ravenkeeper (filesize too big to upload)


# 05.05.2025

### There will be multiple versions as time goes on. 
- Facelift version of the EnderCNC is in "release" stage, CAD wont be updated unless issues arise during use. 
- New Ender3CNC version soon in "BETA". Base 99% on the Ender 3 PRO. Cheaper alternative on vwheels etc.

Picture of the new version.

# 28.04.25

Facelift version built, will do minor tweaking to CAD, but everything fits like it should. New CAD will be uploaded soon.



# 26.03.25

* Uploaded facelift version CAD. This version is NOT tested yet. I will do a full rebuild with this version in the coming weeks.

# 20.03.25

* Udated CAD file. Added new look to the XY joints as the original was kinda lacking in the looks department. Added both dual bearing and single bearing version. (if you want the original one they are also in the CAD) 
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81c28c7d-b4e1-4f66-945f-cb4537701f71)

* Relocated the X endstop to be in-set into the LEFT XY joint.
- (Wires coming out on the other side where the wire loom connects to the XY joint)

* Comparison old vs new.

# 19.03.25

* Added belt tension system for the Y belts on the Y motor carriages.

* Added "splash-guards" to limit debris from spilling over to the Y axis belts and rods. ( need to cut them in half in slicer unless you have a 400mm printer )

* Maktia 700 series ( or other Ã˜65mm spindle ) clamp added.

* Remixed Z carriage for more Z travel. But you'll have to cut the teethed part off a 8mmID 20t pulley, or use another 8mmID locking nut on the Z leadscrew. (lower 20t pulley cut to size on picture below)

* Bigger holes for ziptie cable management.
* Several fixes to the XY joints:
  - Fixed so the X carriage cant home over the Y extrusion.
  - Shorter screws for the Y belt clamps.
  - Longer XY joints with 55mm + 29mm LM bearings for more stability (optional)
  - You can now use either LMK10LUU or LMK10LUU + LM10UU for the XY joints. Using LMK+LMU does not reduce cutting area.


# 02.01.25

* Added 8mm rod mod CAD, using 8mm rods and 2x LMU8 bearings on each side for stiffness. (45mm long x2)


# 22.12.24

* Updated CAD with most of the hardware. Still a little bit left.
* Updated CAD X travel/limit switch for Z to not crash into Y extrusion if X homing without Z homed first. 


# 21.12.24

* Create Github
* Added CAD files
* Added DXF / PDF file of x gantry back plate.
