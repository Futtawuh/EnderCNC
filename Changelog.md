* Remixed Z carriage for more Z travel.
* Bigger holes for ziptie cable management.
* Several fixes to the XY joints:
  - Fixed so the X carriage cant home over the Y extrusion.
  - Shorter screws for the Y belt clamps.
  - Longer XY joints with 55mm + 29mm LM bearings for more stability (optional)
  - You can now use either LMK10LUU or LMK10LUU + LM10UU for the XY joints. Using LMK+LMU does not reduce cutting area.


# 02.01.25

* Added 8mm rod mod CAD, using 8mm rods and 2x LMU8 bearings on each side for stiffness. (45mm long x2)


# 22.12.24

* Updated CAD with most of the hardware. Still a little bit left.
* Updated CAD X travel/limit switch for Z to not crash into Y extrusion if X homing without Z homed first. 


# 21.12.24

* Create Github
* Added CAD files
* Added DXF / PDF file of x gantry back plate.
