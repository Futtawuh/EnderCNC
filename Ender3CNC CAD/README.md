# Ender 3 PRO based CNC (Soon TM)

- reusing as much as possible from the Ender 3 PRO down to the screws.
- cheaper BOM than the original EnderCNC. BOM is mostly just some screws, 2x linear rails for Z and m3/m5 tnuts. 

### reusing:
* Frame
* steppers
* wires (might need to extend some)
* leadscrew
* leadscrew nut
* coupler
* mcu
* psu
* most of the nuts and bolts
* vwheels
* alu spacers
* maybe belts?
* screen if you want
